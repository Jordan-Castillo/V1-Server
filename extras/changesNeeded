Your program didn't pass.  Please fix the things mentioned below

a few.

Remove commented out code and console.logs in your code.
Keep lines under 80 columns, by breaking long lines at a reasonable point
and indenting the continuation by one space, as described in the style sheet.

Use correct horizontal spacing as specified in the style sheet.  This
includes spaces around the = in assignment, around the operators in
expressions, around each keyworkd, after commas in a declaration list, etc.
For instance:

int test1, test2, test4;

if (test1 < test2+1 && test4*3 + 1 > 0)

is much more readable than:

int test1,test2,test4;
if(test1<test2+1&&test4*3+1>0)

Though spaces in a line are generally a good thing, there are a few
places they don't belong.  Don't put spaces before a semicolon, right
parentheses ) or comma and don't put them after a left parentheses (.
Such spaces don't help readability, and they are distracting.

Be sure you have a blank space after each keyword, such as if, while, for,
try, catch, etc.

Read the style sheet for a complete set of rules.

When breaking up long lines of code into multiple lines, indent each line
after the first exactly one space from the first line.

Good:
        This is an example
         of how to properly break
         a long line of code;

Bad:
        This is a bad example
         showing how not to break
          long lines of code;

Bad:
        This is another bad example showing
           how not to break long lines of code;

Your indentation style doesn't always comply with the standard.
Consistently correct indentation is important, and gives your code
a professional appearance.  Be sure you always obey the standard.
